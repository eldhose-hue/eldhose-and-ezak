        <p><h3>The peace full village</h3>

        <i><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">In a quiet valley surrounded by green hills and tall trees,</a> there was a small, peaceful village. The people lived simple, honest lives. Each morning began with birdsong, and every evening ended with laughter and stories. Life was calm and full of warmth.
        At the edge of the village, near the forest, lived an old man named Hari and his daughter Meera. They were known for their kindness. Hari, though aging, cared for a lush garden of vegetables and flowers. Meera spent her days weaving beautiful cloth and embroidering delicate patterns to sell in the market. Their home was modest but filled with love.
    One evening, as the sky turned gold and purple, Meera prepared dinner and Hari rested in his chair. A breeze carried the scent of jasmine through the open window. All seemed peaceful—until a thief crept out from the forest.
    Dressed in black with his face hidden, the thief had watched the village for days. Seeing its quiet nature as weakness, he entered Hari and Meera’s home through an unlocked door. Inside, he found a small wooden box holding Meera’s jewelry and their savings. As he turned to leave, the old wooden floor creaked.
    Hari stirred. “Who’s there?” he called.
     A young man named Arjun, walking nearby, heard her cry. Without hesitation, he ran toward the house. Seeing the thief flee, Arjun chased after him, caught him, and pinned him down. He tied the thief’s hands with a rope from his tool belt.
    The commotion woke nearby villagers. As they gathered, someone went to call the guards. Meera and Hari came outside, shaken but unharmed. Hari, moved to tears, told Arjun, “You’ve saved our home—and our peace.”
   The guards arrived and took the thief away. That night, the villagers lit lanterns in honor of Arjun’s bravery. He stayed for dinner with Hari and Meera, now seen not just as a hero, but family.
    From that day, the village remained united, stronger in spirit. People spoke often of the night courage met danger, and how one brave soul had restored the light.
      And so, peace returned—not unchanged, but deeper, more cherished than ever before.</i>
